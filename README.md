# Web_DevChallenge

## View the site here (note search won't work since can't add valid API key to project for security reasons): https://sman13.github.io/Web_DevChallenge/

## To Use Must change API key. See notes

## Notes

- This site was created as part of a webdev challenge for Shopify.
- Used basic Javascript with the Github API to create a favourites page
- Since this has been made public the **api key** will have to be **changed to a working one** for this to work. Just modify the top of the js file with a new key
